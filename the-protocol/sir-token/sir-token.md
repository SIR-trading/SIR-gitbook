# üìê Optimum Pool Selection



Let $$R$$ \[tokens/day] be the token emission , and let $$r$$ \[tokens/day] be the rate of tokens received by a specific pool. Then, this specific pool's contribution to the DAO is

$$
\text{Fees given to the DAO per pool} = 5\% \frac{r}{R}.
$$



EXPLAIN HOW THIS METHOD ALIGNS TOKEN HOLDERS WITH THE PROTOCOLS BEST INTEREST.



INCENTIVES ALIGNMENT. IT IS IN THE BEST INTEREST OF TOKEN HOLDERS TO POINT THE LIQUIDITY MINING PROGRAM TO THE MOST PROFITABLE POOLS, WHICH IN TURN HELPS THEM STABILIZE FURTHER, MAKING THEM EVEN BETTER IN A POSITIVE FEEDBACK LOOP
