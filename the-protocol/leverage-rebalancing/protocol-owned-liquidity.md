# ðŸš° Protocol Owned Liquidity

Most of the fees are paid to LPers who after all perform the important task of synching the leverage ratio, such that. But 5% of all fees collected are diverged to the protocol which then acts as an LPer. The advantage of protocol owned liquidity (POL) **** over regular LPing**,** is that **POL never will withdraw its collateral**. As the pool continues to exist we an only hope POL will grow, and consequently further increase the stability of the pool.

{% hint style="warning" %}
While protocol owned liquidity may be regarded as parasitic by the LPers, the cut taken by POL is a tiny fraction (5%) of all collected fees.
