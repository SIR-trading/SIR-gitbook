# What is SIR?

Synthetics Implemented Right (SIR) is an innovative addition to the DeFi landscape, introducing a new means of creating two distinct types of synthetic tokens:

1. <mark style="background-color:blue;">Constant-leverage tokens,</mark> which are ideal for **long-term investors** seeking higher returns through leveraged positions.
2. <mark style="background-color:green;">Pegged tokens</mark>, including **trustless stablecoins**, which maintain a stable value and offer minimal risk.

Our design of SIR has been inspired by the belief that

> Trustless economic bandwidth is **trust-minimized** fuel for an open economy. Combine this with **permissionless money protocols** and itâ€™s an unstoppable force for money and finance at large.
