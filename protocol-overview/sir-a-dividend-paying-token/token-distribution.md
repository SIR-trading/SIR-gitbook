# üç∞ Token Distribution

## Emission Schedule

### Constant Rate Model
- **Annual Emission:** 2.015 billion SIR per year
- **Starting Supply:** Zero at launch
- **Distribution Frequency:** Continuous (every second)
- **Duration:** Perpetual (no end date)

### Phased Allocation Strategy

#### Years 1-3: Bootstrap Phase
During the initial three years, emissions support both protocol development and liquidity growth through diversified allocation.

#### Year 4+: Full Liquidity Focus
After year three, <mark style="background-color:yellow;">**100% of emissions flow to liquidity providers**</mark>, ensuring sustainable long-term incentives.

## Current Allocation Structure

### Post-Hack Relaunch (Years 1-3)

Following the protocol redesign, the emission breakdown for the first three years is:

| Recipient | Allocation | Purpose |
|-----------|------------|---------|
| <mark style="background-color:yellow;">**Liquidity Providers**</mark> | 51.31% | Protocol liquidity incentives |
| <mark style="background-color:blue;">**Team & Contributors**</mark> | 13.65% | Development and operations |
| <mark style="background-color:purple;">**Hack Victims Fund**</mark> | 12.00% | [Compensation for losses](../exploit-and-relaunch.md) |
| <mark style="background-color:green;">**Protocol Treasury**</mark> | 10.00% | Strategic reserves & development |
| <mark style="background-color:red;">**Presale Investors**</mark> | 8.22% | Early funding supporters |
| <mark style="background-color:orange;">**Public Sale**</mark> | 4.17% | Community distribution |
| **Unallocated** | 0.65% | Reserve for future needs |

**Total Annual Emissions (Years 1-3):** 2.015 billion SIR

### Original Allocation (Pre-Hack)

The initial protocol design allocated first three years' emissions as:

| Recipient | Allocation | 
|-----------|------------|
| <mark style="background-color:yellow;">**Liquidity Providers**</mark> | 68.13% |
| <mark style="background-color:blue;">**Team & Contributors**</mark> | 13.65% |
| <mark style="background-color:green;">**Protocol Treasury**</mark> | 10.00% |
| <mark style="background-color:red;">**Investors**</mark> | 8.22% |

## Strategic Rationale

### Why This Distribution?

**Liquidity First:** Even during bootstrap phase, majority (51.31%) flows to LPers, ensuring deep liquidity from day one.

**Aligned Incentives:** Team allocation ensures long-term commitment while treasury reserves enable strategic flexibility.

**Fair Compensation:** Hack victims receive meaningful restitution without compromising protocol viability.

**Sustainable Transition:** Gradual shift to 100% LP rewards creates predictable, long-term incentives.

### Long-Term Vision

After year three, the protocol transitions to a pure liquidity incentive model:
- **100% to LPers:** All emissions support protocol liquidity
- **Self-Sustaining:** Protocol fees fund operations via SIR staking dividends
- **Market-Driven:** Success depends entirely on protocol utility and adoption

This structure ensures SIR evolves from a bootstrap token to a mature, utility-driven asset with permanent liquidity incentives.
