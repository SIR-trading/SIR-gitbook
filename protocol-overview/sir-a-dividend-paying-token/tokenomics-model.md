# ðŸ’° Tokenomics Model

## The Three-Token Ecosystem

The SIR protocol operates through a synergistic three-token model, each serving distinct but interconnected roles:

### SIR Token: Governance & Value Capture
- **Dividend Distribution:** Stake SIR to earn a share of protocol fees paid in WETH
- **Continuous Issuance:** 2.015 billion SIR per year, creating sustainable liquidity incentives
- **Future Governance:** Control treasury and direct reward allocations across vaults

### TEA Token: Liquidity Provision
- **Liquidity Representation:** Mint TEA by depositing assets; burn to withdraw
- **Fee Structure:** 9% upfront deposit fee (retained as protocol-owned liquidity)
- **Revenue Streams:**
  - Primary: Trading fees from APE leverage positions
  - Secondary: SIR token rewards for selected vaults

### APE Token: Leverage Positions
- **Position Management:** Minted when opening leverage, burned when closing
- **Revenue Generation:** Trading activity drives protocol fees distributed to stakeholders

## Business Model Architecture

### From a Business Perspective

The protocol's economic model can be understood through traditional business roles:

**Customers:** APE holders (leverage traders) who pay fees for leveraged positions. They are the primary revenue generators for the ecosystem.

**Service Providers:** TEA holders (liquidity providers) act as intermediaries, enabling leverage capacity. Greater TEA liquidity allows higher leverage potential, attracting more APE users.

**Stakeholders:** SIR holders capture value through dividends and governance rights, aligning their interests with protocol growth.

### Revenue Flow
1. APE holders generate fees through leverage trading
2. Fees flow to TEA holders (90%) and SIR stakers (up to 10%)
3. SIR emissions incentivize TEA liquidity provision
4. Increased liquidity attracts more APE users, creating a growth flywheel

## Sustainable Tokenomics Design

### Why Constant Issuance?

Unlike projects with capped supplies that front-load emissions, SIR maintains constant issuance for several strategic reasons:

**Long-term Viability:** High initial emissions followed by reduction creates unsustainable dynamics. As emissions decrease, new participants have less incentive to join, potentially leading to protocol forks or competitive disadvantages.

**Fair Opportunity:** Constant issuance ensures future liquidity providers (when TVL is higher) can still earn meaningful rewards, while early participants benefit from easier accumulation when liquidity is lower.

**Transparent Predictability:** Instead of teams selling tokens unpredictably to fund operations, SIR embeds liquidity incentives directly into the protocol in a transparent, permanent manner.

### The Best of Both Worlds

For participants seeking to optimize their position:
- **Stake SIR:** Earn ETH dividends from protocol fees
- **Provide Liquidity:** Earn SIR rewards to offset dilution
- **Do Both:** LP and stake earned SIR for maximum benefit (no dilution + ETH dividends)

## Protocol-Owned Liquidity Strategy

The SIR protocol implements a unique approach to liquidity sustainability through its [Protocol-Owned Liquidity (POL) mechanism](../../liquidity-and-leverage/protocol-owned-liquidity.md).

### Key Innovation: The 9% Capture

Every liquidity deposit (TEA minting) contributes 9% directly to permanent protocol reserves. This transforms the traditional liquidity paradigm:

**Traditional Approach:** Protocols temporarily "rent" liquidity through incentives that must be continuously paid
**SIR Approach:** Immediate partial acquisition of liquidity that compounds forever

### Strategic Impact
- **Permanent Base:** POL never withdraws, providing unshakeable foundation liquidity
- **Compound Growth:** POL earns fees alongside other LPers, continuously growing
- **Reduced Mercenary Risk:** Less dependence on temporary liquidity providers
- **Long-term Alignment:** Creates a self-reinforcing system where success breeds stability

For detailed mechanics and benefits, see the dedicated [Protocol-Owned Liquidity section](../../liquidity-and-leverage/protocol-owned-liquidity.md).

## Economic Alignment

### Incentive Structure

The protocol aligns all participant incentives toward sustainable growth:

1. **APE Users:** Access leverage with predictable fees and deep liquidity
2. **TEA Holders:** Earn stable income from fees plus SIR rewards
3. **SIR Holders:** Capture protocol value through dividends and price appreciation
4. **Protocol Treasury:** Accumulates permanent liquidity for long-term resilience

### Mathematical Optimization

Reward distribution follows economic contribution:
- Vaults receive SIR proportional to fees generated
- Maximum 10% fee redistribution ensures LPer profitability
- Quadratic constraint (âˆšÎ£fiÂ² â‰¤ 10%) optimizes allocation efficiency

This creates a self-balancing system where the most productive vaults naturally attract appropriate incentives, maximizing capital efficiency across the protocol.
