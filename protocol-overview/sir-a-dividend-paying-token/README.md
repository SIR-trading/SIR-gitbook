description: The Core Value-Capturing Token of the SIR Protocol

# 💎 Tokenomics

SIR holders can stake their tokens to earn a share of protocol fees. All fees are converted to the chain's native wrapped token (WETH on Ethereum, WHYPE on HyperEVM, WETH on MegaETH) through an [auction system](../token-auctions.md) and distributed to stakers, providing a direct claim on the protocol's revenue.

The SIR protocol features a carefully designed token economy that aligns incentives across all participants while ensuring long-term sustainability. This section explores how the three-token system works together to create a self-reinforcing ecosystem.

## Overview

At its core, SIR solves a fundamental DeFi challenge: how to sustainably incentivize liquidity while capturing value for token holders. The protocol achieves this through:

* **Three specialized tokens** (SIR, TEA, APE) each serving distinct roles
* **Permanent liquidity accumulation** through protocol-owned liquidity
* **Constant token emission** ensuring fair opportunity for all participants
* **Mathematical optimization** for efficient capital allocation

* **Flexible Operations:** Stake, unstake, and claim dividends at any time
* **Dividends:** All protocol fees are converted to the chain's native wrapped token via [auctions](../token-auctions.md) for consistent payouts
* **Pro-rata Distribution:** Rewards proportional to your staked share
