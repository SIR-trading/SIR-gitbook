# üíé Tokenomics

The SIR protocol features a carefully designed token economy that aligns incentives across all participants while ensuring long-term sustainability. This section explores how the three-token system works together to create a self-reinforcing ecosystem.

## Overview

At its core, SIR solves a fundamental DeFi challenge: how to sustainably incentivize liquidity while capturing value for token holders. The protocol achieves this through:

- **Three specialized tokens** (SIR, TEA, APE) each serving distinct roles
- **Permanent liquidity accumulation** through protocol-owned liquidity
- **Constant token emission** ensuring fair opportunity for all participants
- **Mathematical optimization** for efficient capital allocation
