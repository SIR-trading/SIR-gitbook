# üíé Tokenomics

The SIR protocol features a carefully designed token economy that aligns incentives across all participants while ensuring long-term sustainability. This section explores how the three-token system works together to create a self-reinforcing ecosystem.

## Overview

At its core, SIR solves a fundamental DeFi challenge: how to sustainably incentivize liquidity while capturing value for token holders. The protocol achieves this through:

- **Three specialized tokens** (SIR, TEA, APE) each serving distinct roles
- **Permanent liquidity accumulation** through protocol-owned liquidity
- **Constant token emission** ensuring fair opportunity for all participants
- **Mathematical optimization** for efficient capital allocation

Deep dive into how the SIR token works‚Äîstaking mechanisms, dividend distribution, governance rights, and the innovative constant emission model that ensures sustainable growth.

### [üí∞ Economic Model](economic-model.md)  
Explore the three-token ecosystem from a business perspective. Understand how APE traders, TEA providers, and SIR holders interact to create value, and why constant issuance beats traditional capped supply models.

### [üç∞ Token Distribution](token-distribution.md)
Detailed breakdown of how SIR tokens are allocated during the bootstrap phase (years 1-3) and the transition to 100% liquidity provider rewards thereafter.

## Key Innovations

**Protocol-Owned Liquidity:** Every TEA deposit contributes 9% to permanent protocol reserves, building an unshakeable foundation that compounds over time.

**Aligned Incentives:** Whether you're seeking leverage (APE), providing liquidity (TEA), or staking for dividends (SIR), the protocol ensures all participants benefit from its growth.

**Sustainable Economics:** Unlike protocols that "rent" liquidity through unsustainable emissions, SIR creates permanent value through its unique tokenomics design.
