# ðŸŽ© SIR: A Dividend-Paying Token

SIR is not only the protocol but also its native token and it plays a multifaceted role:

* **A Speculative Vehicle:** SIR attracts those bullish on the protocol's future. A portion of all fees collected is distributed to SIR stakers, making it an appealing option for speculation and investment.
* **Liquidity Mining Embedded in the Protocol:** SIR tokens are distributed to liquidity providers (LPers) as an incentive to enhance liquidity within key, selected vaults, starting from the protocol's launch and continuing indefinitely. While the allocation of rewards across vaults can be adjusted, this mechanism is integrated into the protocol's core contracts, ensuring its permanence and ongoing support for liquidity.
* **Governance and Reward Distribution:** The SIR DAO, powered by SIR holders, has the unique role of deciding which vaults are rewarded for their contributions. This setup aligns the interests of SIR holders with the protocol's success, as they aim to maximize rewards through strategic decision-making.

## **Integration and Emission**

SIR's issuance will start as soon as the protocol launches, with its functions and mechanisms locked in. The token is emitted at a constant rate of **2015 million SIR per year**. This model supports both early adopters and those who join later, ensuring a fair distribution of rewards over time.

### **First Three Years and Beyond**

In the initial three years, selected vaults receive a share of SIR emissions, with the entirety of emissions directed to them afterward. Contributors, including early LPers, are rewarded at the same rate as everyone else, promoting a balanced contribution ecosystem.

## **Liquidity Mining as a Core Feature**

Many protocol tokens opt for a limited supply to enhance their appeal among buyers, a trend influenced by Bitcoin's model. However, structuring a token with high initial emissions followed by reduced or negligible emissions over time can ultimately hinder the protocol's long-term viability, or as Fiskantes puts it:

Contrary to temporary incentives seen in other projects, SIR's liquidity mining is designed to be an enduring aspect of the protocol. It aims to stabilize the protocol by ensuring ongoing rewards for liquidity provision.

### **Fair and Incentivized Distribution**

Rewards are distributed based on the fees generated by each vault, ensuring a direct correlation between contribution and compensation. This method is designed to be fair and transparent, rewarding those vaults that contribute most to the protocol's liquidity.

## **Governance and Community Engagement**

The DAO's focus is on rewarding vaults, a decision that directly affects the protocol's liquidity and, by extension, its stability and success. SIR holders, through the DAO, participate in governance, guiding the protocol towards rewarding the most valuable contributors.

In summary, SIR isn't just a token but a critical component of the protocol's incentive structure, governance, and long-term strategy. It's designed to encourage participation, reward contribution, and ensure the protocol's sustainable growth.
