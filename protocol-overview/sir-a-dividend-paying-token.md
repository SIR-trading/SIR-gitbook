# ðŸŽ© SIR: A Dividend-Paying Token

SIR is not only the protocol but also its native token and it plays a multifaceted role:

* **A Speculative Vehicle:** The SIR token offers holders a claim on the protocol's fees, establishing strong fundamentals for the token and positioning it as a prime vehicle for speculation on the protocol's success.
* **Liquidity Mining Embedded in the Protocol:** SIR tokens are distributed to liquidity providers (LPers) as an incentive to enhance liquidity within key, selected vaults, starting from the protocol's launch and continuing indefinitely. While the allocation of rewards across vaults can be adjusted, this mechanism is integrated into the protocol's core contracts, ensuring its permanence and ongoing support for liquidity.
* **Governance and Reward Allocation:** The SIR DAO, powered by SIR holders, has the unique role of deciding which vaults are rewarded with SIR issuance in exchange for a portion of their fees. This setup aligns the interests of SIR holders with the protocol's success, as best vaults to allocated rewards are also those that generate the highest fees.

## **Liquidity Mining as a Core Feature**

### Constant Issuance Rate

Many protocol tokens opt for a limited supply to enhance their appeal among buyers, a trend influenced by Bitcoin's model. However, structuring a token with high initial emissions followed by reduced or negligible emissions over time can ultimately hinder the protocol's long-term viability as Fiskantes explains:

SIR's issuance will start as soon as the protocol launches, with its functions and mechanisms locked in. The token is emitted at a constant rate of **2015 million SIR per year** _ad infinitum_. Early holders benefit from generous rewards in a nascent ecosystem and the potential token appreciation. Later entrants benefit from the steady emission rate and higher valuation. To mitigate dilution gentlemen can keep their liquidity in the protocol.

## **Integration and Emission**

SIR's issuance will start as soon as the protocol launches, with its functions and mechanisms locked in. The token is emitted at a constant rate of **2015 million SIR per year**. This model supports both early adopters and those who join later, ensuring a fair distribution of rewards over time.

### **First Three Years and Beyond**

In the initial three years, selected vaults receive a share of SIR emissions, with the entirety of emissions directed to them afterward. Contributors, including early LPers, are rewarded at the same rate as everyone else, promoting a balanced contribution ecosystem.

### **Fair and Incentivized Distribution**

Rewards are distributed based on the fees generated by each vault, ensuring a direct correlation between contribution and compensation. This method is designed to be fair and transparent, rewarding those vaults that contribute most to the protocol's liquidity.

## **Governance and Community Engagement**

The DAO's focus is on rewarding vaults, a decision that directly affects the protocol's liquidity and, by extension, its stability and success. SIR holders, through the DAO, participate in governance, guiding the protocol towards rewarding the most valuable contributors.

In summary, SIR isn't just a token but a critical component of the protocol's incentive structure, governance, and long-term strategy. It's designed to encourage participation, reward contribution, and ensure the protocol's sustainable growth.
