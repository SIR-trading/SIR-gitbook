# Gentlemen vs. Apes

Make the next section with the following content:

Gentlemen & Apes: A Uniswap-like approach for a new type of DeFi primitive - Trustless, LPers and users, permissionless vault creation - For every vault, SIR produces two tokens. Gentlemen receive TEA which represents their LP position and can be burnt any time. Apes receive APE which is a ERC-20 leveraged token that can be used outside of the protocol and whose value is designed to follow a power-law of the underlying asset: $q = p^(l-1)$

I explained some related concepts before:

In the power zone the portion of collateral in the reserve owned by the apes follows the power law: A' = (p'/p)^(l-1)A where ' denotes the new one, l is the leverage, and p is the price.
