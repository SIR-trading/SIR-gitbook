# üíä Exploit & Relaunch

## Incident Overview

On **March 30, 2025**, SIR Trading's vault was drained of its entire $355 K TVL when an attacker weaponized Ethereum's new **transient storage** (TSTORE/TLOAD) feature:

1. **Setup**
   * Attacker deployed a custom Uniswap V3 pool and initialized a vault in our Vault contract.
   * During `uniswapV3SwapCallback`, the code `TSTORE(slot=0x1, poolAddress)` was immediately overwritten by `TSTORE(slot=0x1, mintAmount)`, leaving stale data.
2. **Vanity‚ÄêAddress Exploit**
   * By brute‚Äêforcing a **CREATE2** address whose numeric value equaled the forged `mintAmount`, the attacker passed our pool-address check.
   * They repeatedly invoked `uniswapV3SwapCallback`, siphoning all collateral through the compromised slot.
3. **Stolen Funds Trail**
   * Initial funds (0.3 ETH) came from #Railgun, per MistTrack.io.
   * Attack TX: [`0xa05f047ddfdad9126624c4496b5d4a59f961ee7c091e7b4e38cee86f1335736f`](https://etherscan.io/tx/0xa05f047ddfdad9126624c4496b5d4a59f961ee7c091e7b4e38cee86f1335736f)&#x20;
   * Attacker: `0x27defcfa6498f957918f407ed8a58eba2884768c`&#x20;

{% hint style="warning" %}
**Root cause:** our callback logic did not clear or re-validate the transient‚Äêstorage slot between operations, allowing a crafted value to masquerade as the pool address.
