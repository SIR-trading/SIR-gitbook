# 🔒 Audits

SIR has been audited by multiple independent security firms. After the [March 2025 exploit](../exploit-and-relaunch.md), the protocol was rebuilt and subjected to four comprehensive audits before relaunching.

## MegaETH Launch Audit

## Post-Relaunch Audits (Ethereum)

These four audits were completed on the rewritten codebase before the protocol went live again:

## Ongoing Security

Security is an ongoing commitment. In addition to audits, SIR maintains:

- A [Bug Bounty](bug-bounty.md) program rewarding high and critical vulnerability disclosures
- A [Beta Period](beta-period.md) with protocol state controls (Emergency Mode, Shutdown) as safety guardrails
- Immutable, non-upgradable core contracts — once deployed, the code cannot be changed
