# 🐛 Bug Bounty Program

## Overview

SIR is committed to the security of our protocol and users' funds. Following the March 2025 exploit and successful relaunch with four independent security audits, we continue to invite security researchers to help identify vulnerabilities in our core smart contracts through our bug bounty program.

## Scope

The bug bounty program covers **high and critical severity vulnerabilities** in the SIR core contracts across all deployed chains (Ethereum, HyperEVM, and MegaETH). All verified contract addresses can be found in the [Deployments](../deployments.md) section.

**Bug Bounty Reward Address:** [`0x589F8D40370C9B5904f83B9C17815DDdB3eb6af9`](https://etherscan.io/address/0x589F8D40370C9B5904f83B9C17815DDdB3eb6af9)

This address holds the SIR tokens allocated for bug bounty rewards, visible on-chain for transparency.

### In Scope
- Core protocol contracts on all chains
- Critical vulnerabilities that could lead to:
  - Loss of user funds
  - Protocol insolvency
  - Unauthorized access to privileged functions
  - Manipulation of core protocol mechanics

### Out of Scope
- Frontend bugs
- Third-party integrations
- Already known issues
- Issues in test contracts or deprecated contracts

## Severity Levels & Rewards

The bug bounty address initially holds **20,000,000 SIR tokens**, with plans to add more SIR over time to ensure competitive rewards for security researchers. As the protocol's TVL and SIR token price appreciate, so does the value of the bounty reward.

**Bounty Reward:** The full amount of SIR tokens held in the bug bounty address

### High/Critical Severity
Eligible vulnerabilities include:
- Direct theft of user funds
- Permanent or temporary freezing of funds
- Protocol insolvency
- Theft of yield
- Significant protocol manipulation
- Unauthorized access to privileged functions

High and critical severity vulnerabilities that meet the criteria will be rewarded with **the full amount of SIR tokens available in the bug bounty address**.
