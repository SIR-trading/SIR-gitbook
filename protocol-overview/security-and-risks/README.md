## Security First Approach

SIR prioritizes security through:
- **External Audits**: Professional security audits by [Egis Security](https://github.com/Egis-Security/audits/blob/main/reports/SIR-Trading.pdf)
- **Bug Bounty Program**: Incentivizing white hat hackers to find and report vulnerabilities
- **Beta Testing**: Gradual rollout with careful monitoring
- **Transparent Communication**: Clear documentation of risks and security measures
