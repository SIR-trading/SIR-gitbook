# ðŸŒ± Protocol Owned Liquidity

Fees from apes are distributed to all LPers which includes gentlemen and Protocol-Owned Liquidity (POL). Additionally, 9% of every gentleman's initial deposit is allocated to POL, which then acts as a permanent, ever-growing LPer. Since POL itself is an LPer, it earns ongoing fees alongside other providers while never exiting the vault. POL offers a distinct advantage over traditional liquidity provisioning: POL is permanent and will never withdraw. Over time, as the vault matures, POL has the potential to grow, thereby bolstering the vault's stability.
