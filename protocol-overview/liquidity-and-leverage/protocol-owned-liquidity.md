# ðŸŒ± Protocol Owned Liquidity

The majority of fees are rewarded to the gentlemen (LPers), who play a crucial role in maintaining the constant leverage ratio. However, 9% of every gentleman's deposit is distributed to the protocol itself, allowing it to function as a liquidity provider. Protocol owned liquidity (POL), offers a distinct advantage over traditional liquidity provisioning: POL is permanent and will never withdraw. Over time, as the vault matures, POL has the potential to grow, thereby bolstering the vault's stability.
