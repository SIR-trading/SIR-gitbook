description: A New DeFi Protocol for Safer Leverage

# Introducing SIR

SIR is a DeFi protocol designed to address the key challenges of leveraged trading, such as volatility decay and liquidation risks, making it safer for long-term investing. Here's how SIR stands out:

* **Volatility Decay Elimination:** Unlike traditional leveraged ETFs that lose value in stagnant markets due to volatility decay, SIR ensures that its leveraged tokens maintain their value over time. This is achieved through a mechanism that keeps leverage constant, regardless of market movements.
* **No Funding Fees for Holding Positions:** SIR differentiates itself by not charging any funding fees while you hold a position. Fees are only applied when minting or burning leveraged tokens, reducing the cost of maintaining long-term leveraged positions.
* **Trustless Leveraged Trading:** Leveraging Uniswap v3's oracle, SIR operates in a trustless environment, crucial for integrating with other DeFi protocols and ensuring security and reliability.
* **Innovative Fee and Leverage Mechanism:** SIR introduces an innovative approach to calculate the value of its leveraged tokens, using a power-law formula that eliminates the need for external transactions for rebalancing. This method ensures that leverage is perfectly constant, solving the problem of volatility decay without external dependencies.

SIR is designed for investors looking for small, quickly compounding leverage over the long term, in a maximally trustless setting. By only charging fees on token minting and burning, and addressing the issue of volatility decay internally, SIR offers a more efficient and safer way to engage in leveraged trading in the crypto space.
