# What is SIR?

Synthetics Implemented Right (SIR) is a new DeFi primitive for the issuance of 2 type of synthetic tokens:

1. <mark style="background-color:blue;">constant-leverage tokens,</mark> suitable for **long-term investing**,&#x20;
2. <mark style="background-color:green;">pegged tokens</mark>, including **trustless stablecoins**

We built SIR from first principles with the following quote ([ETH is irreplacable ](https://newsletter.banklesshq.com/p/eth-is-irreplaceable#%C2%A7eyes-on-the-prize)by Ryan S. Adams) in mind:

> Trustless economic bandwidth is **trust-minimized** fuel for an open economy. Combine this with **permissionless money protocols** and itâ€™s an unstoppable force for money and finance at large.

So SIR is...

| permissionless | Anyone with a wallet can mint & burn.                                                                                                                                                  |
| -------------: | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
|      immutable | <p>Non-upgradeable smart contracts.<br>No tunable parameters.*</p>                                                                                                                     |
|         atomic | It a self-contained protocol whose only external dependency is the [Uniswap v3](https://uniswap.org/) oracle. Uniswap v3 is also permissionless/immutable/atomic, i.e., **trustless**. |

\* During the beta period a multisig formed by developers and advisors will have the permission to freeze minting. so that in case of a critical bug users can be stopped from minting and depositing more capital. Withdrawals can never be halted.
