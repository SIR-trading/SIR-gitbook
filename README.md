# üì∏ TL;DR ‚Äì The Ultrashort Summary

Did you ever <mark style="background-color:purple;">**want to take on leverage**</mark> because you were bullish on an asset?

But you did not leverage up <img src=".gitbook/assets/super-saiyan-transformation.gif" alt="" data-size="line">because of <mark style="background-color:red;">**all the associated risks**</mark>** ** ‚ò†Ô∏è?

{% hint style="danger" %}
This is a common problem among crypto plebs, degens and even pros.[ I mean Su Zhu got liquidated for god's sake!](https://nymag.com/intelligencer/article/three-arrows-capital-kyle-davies-su-zhu-crash.html) üò±
{% endhint %}

If price moves against you, your position can get liquidated...

....meaning your assets are kaput, GONE, **VANISHED**.

### Rebalancing Your Debt

Instead, in SIR, <mark style="background-color:green;">**the borrowed capital is adjusted as price fluctuates**</mark>.&#x20;

1. Price of your asset goes up :chart\_with\_upwards\_trend: ‚û† take on more debt and invest more!
2. Price goes down :chart\_with\_downwards\_trend: ‚û† better pay off some of your debt (to avoid getting liquidated).

You may say... but this is no different than leveraged ETFs such as [ETH2X-FLI](https://indexcoop.com/ethereum-flexible-leverage-index-eth2xfli).

<mark style="color:red;">**THE PROBLEM**</mark> with all these leveraged ETFs is that the your portfolio will go down over the long-term if the underlying remains flat!

See [Squeeth](https://squeeth.opyn.co/) as an example:
