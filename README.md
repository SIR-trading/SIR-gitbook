# üì∏ TL;DR



Did you ever <mark style="background-color:purple;">**want to take on leverage**</mark> because you were bullish on an asset?

But you did not leverage up because of <mark style="background-color:red;">**all the associated risks**</mark> <mark style="background-color:red;"></mark><mark style="background-color:red;">‚ò†Ô∏è</mark>?

This is a common problem among crypto plebs, degens and even pros.[ I mean Su Zhu got liquidated for god's sake!](https://nymag.com/intelligencer/article/three-arrows-capital-kyle-davies-su-zhu-crash.html) üò±

If price moves against you, your position can get liquidated, meaning your assets are kaput, gone, vanished.

Instead, in SIR, <mark style="background-color:green;">**the borrowed capital is adjusted as price fluctuates**</mark>.&#x20;

Price of your asset goes up :chart\_with\_upwards\_trend:, take on more debt and invest more!

Price goes down :chart\_with\_downwards\_trend:, better sell some assets and pay off some of your debt to avoid getting liquidated.

You may say... but this is no different than leveraged ETFs such as [ETH2X-FLI](https://indexcoop.com/ethereum-flexible-leverage-index-eth2xfli) or [Squeeth](https://squeeth.opyn.co/).

<mark style="color:red;">**THE PROBLEM**</mark> with all these leveraged ETFs is that the your portfolio will go down over the long-term if the underlying remains flat!

<figure><img src=".gitbook/assets/image.png" alt=""><figcaption><p>On May the price of ETH was the same than in the beginning of the chart, but Squeeth had already lost a fair chunk of value. üò•</p></figcaption></figure>

Thanks to a new design, <mark style="background-color:orange;">**SIR has no volatility decay because it rebalances instantly**</mark> and charges <mark style="background-color:blue;">**no fee while holding a position**</mark>.

Now you can <mark style="background-color:purple;">**hold your leveraged position for as long as you wish**</mark> and your money will not dissipate away.

Happy investing. [üéâ](https://emojipedia.org/party-popper/)
