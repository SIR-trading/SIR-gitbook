# üè¶ Leverage & Collateralization

INCLUDE DERIVATION??? CHECK WP. MAYBE MOVE IT AFTER NEXT SECTION

APE's leverage ratio ($$l$$) and TEA's collateralization factor ($$r$$) are are 1-to-1 related through the formula:

$$
\begin{equation}
(r-1)(l-1)=1.
\end{equation}
$$

In combination with the expression in [#leverage-ratio-discrete-set](../protocol-intro.md#leverage-ratio-discrete-set "mention"), we obtain that the collateralization factor belongs to the following set

$$
\begin{equation}
r=1+2^{-k}
\end{equation}
$$

as a function of the fee tier $$k\in[-20,-19,\ldots,19,20]$$.
